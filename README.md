# Easy PBR Bake
With this add-on you can bake all your PBR map textures with a single click.

## Material Setup
You can have multiple materials, but all of them should use the Principled Shader. You don't need to add an active Texture Image node to specify where to bake your textures. That is specified in the bake options.

## Features
* Option to automatically generate the texture names (by appending a suffix to the base name).
* Pack the metallic, roughness and ambient occlusion channels into a single texture.

## Available maps
- [x] Albedo
- [x] Metallic
- [x] Roughness
- [x] Ambient Occlusion
- [x] Normal map
- [ ] Subsurface scattering
